    abstract = {Online forums contain a substantial amount of data, but very few studies have focused on mining the URLs posted by users. How can we fully leverage these posted URLs to extract as much information as possible about forum users? We perform a systematic study for extracting as much information as possible about forum users via their URL posting behavior. Within this study we develop a series of tools to analyze the data. Given a forum, we extract the following information: (a) basic statistics and a profile of the forum, (b) a profile for each user based on their referral to accounts in other platforms, (c) identification of communities within the forum, and (d) detection of malicious behavior. Most prior works focus on analyzing the text found in user posts rather than on URLs themselves, as we do here. In our study, we analyze three online security forums and find interesting results: (a) we identify 7% of the users posting social media links on other platforms, (b) we detect 148 groups of users that engage in communities on external social media platforms, (c) we expose 139 malicious users that collectively posted 328 malicious URLs. Additionally, we identify 17 groups with membership spanning across multiple forums, and discover numerous other groups that engage in coordinated malicious behavior. Our work is a significant step towards an all-encompassing system for profiling forum users at large.}

    abstract = {How can we quantify the influence among repos- itories in online archives like GitHub? Determining repository influence is an essential building block for understanding the dynamics of GitHub-like software archives. The key challenge is to define the appropriate representation model of influence that captures the nuances of the concept and considers its diverse manifestations. We propose PIMan, a systematic approach to quantify the influence among the repositories in a software archive by focusing on the social level interactions. As our key novelty, we introduce the concept of Plausible Influence which considers three types of information: (a) repository level interactions, (b) author level interactions, and (c) temporal considerations. We evaluate and apply our method using 2089 malware repositories from GitHub spanning approximately 12 years. First, we show how our approach provides a powerful and flexible way to generate a plausible influence graph whose density is determined by the Plausible Influence Threshold (PIT), which is modifiable to meet the needs of a study. Second, we find that there is a significant collaboration and influence among the repositories in our dataset. We identify 28 connected components in the plausible influence graph (P IT = 0.25) with 7% of the components containing at least 15 repositories. Furthermore, we find 19 repositories that influenced at least 10 other repositories directly and spawned at least two “families” of repositories. In addition, the results show that our influence metrics capture the manifold aspects of the interactions that are not captured by the typical repository popularity metrics (e.g. number of stars). Overall, our work is a fundamental building block for identifying the influence and lineage of the repositories in online software platforms.}
