I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at **UC Riverside** (MAVERICS Lab, advisor: Michalis Faloutsos).  
My research focuses on (i) **propagation of vulnerabilities across GitHub repositories**, and (ii) **retrieval systems for GitHub repositories** (e.g., functional similarity search).  
**Graduating:** **June 2026**. I am applying for academic positions in the 2025â€“2026 cycle.
